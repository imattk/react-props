# Not my first react app but.
this was my first time putting one on github

using "git" to push this from vs code to github
this was my first time attempting to push from the terminal to github. 
I am getting much better at command line and using the terminal.

In this project I learned a great deal about intro to React and we covered
-props
-mapping data

this is something I had previously learned in a Udemy course but awesome to get a refresher! 

I have the files here. now i just need to figure out how to make it run!
